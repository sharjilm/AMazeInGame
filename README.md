# AMazeInGame
A program that was developed as a final project for the software architectural design course (SFWRENG 3A04). In this program, the user has to complete 5 minigames to collect the stars which are needed to complete the game. This game was written in Python using the Pygame module.

## Todo
\[ ] Minigame 1 (Niyatha) - Player has to collect objects scattered around minigame map before time runs out.

\[ ] Minigame 2 (Albert) - User explores one of a set of predetermined mazes. Each maze has a unique layout with a variety of items of different scores that can be picked up. There is also a bot for each maze that moves along a predetermined path. The player and bot compete against each other in collecting items. When all items have been collected, the user wins if they have a higher score. If the user loses, they lose health proportional to the difference in score..(Bot can be further developed to be able to make pathing decisions instead of predetermined paths).  

\[ ] Minigame 3 (Bassel) -  User has to last for x seconds in the minigame without being hit by projectiles which come flying in from different edges of the screen (can have 1 life, can have multiple, etc) -- similar to some undertale boss fights.

\[ ] Minigame 4 (Sharjil) - User has to go through the maze where they have to collect the items that are on the map while filling up all possible spaces leading to the exit. If the user collects the item but does not fill the map with bricks, they will have to restart the game. The game will be completed if they collect all the items and fill the map with bricks in less than 25 seconds. This game is inspired by Club Penguin's Thin Ice minigame.

\[ ] Minigame 5 (Youssef) - The user uses the spacebar to shoot a certain number of enemies and solve the maze before time runs out.
